# About The Project
This repository holds a set of scripts for a publication in preperation. These scripts are an application of the CCDC algorithm in Google Earth Engine. See Zhu & Woodcock (2012), Zhu and Woodcock (2014) and Zhu et al. (2015) for more information about the CCDC algorithm. For the CCDC helper functions used in this script, see Arévalo et al (2020).
